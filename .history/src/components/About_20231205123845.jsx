              I am a driven Full Stack Software Engineer that brings the
              patience and love for the process into every day of my work. My
              experience as a business owner and leader in the animal behavior
              industry gives me a strong foundation to stand on when approaching
              unique and challenging problems. Open and empathetic
              communication, persistence through difficult and uncomfortable
              moments, and a commitment to learning and growing as a
              professional and a person are all at the forefront of my everyday
              self-development. As a perpetual learner, I canâ€™t stop myself from
              constantly picking up a new book or online course. I believe
              self-driven learning to be the most rewarding thing to engage in.
              This principle is what has propelled me into software engineering.
              The ever-evolving landscape of tech presents me with new articles
              to read, new libraries to learn, and new connections to make on a
              regular basis, and I thrive in it. I look forward to bringing my
              joy and passion for learning and growing into an organization and
              community that shares my passion for tech!
